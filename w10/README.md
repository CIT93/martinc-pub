The demonstration did help to enlighten me about functions by explaining it through a different means. Mainly with the difference between arguments and parameters. when you pass or send a value into a function it becomes an argument. when you recieve it, it becomes a parameter. by passing in a value, Java script evaluates the expression and if there is a return then it returns the result and then a const is assigned a value if a const has been stated with the according reference or argument. Although it did help to explain, I feel like I will have to further review the example in the video in addition to webdev to better understand the step by step process
