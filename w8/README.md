From the renderTbl , after submiting the form, the addEventListener begins to render the variables in its form that make up the cfpdata. the variables are then initialized and then ouputs the first name and carbon footprint total before it is reset upon submiting an additional form.
I found the walkthru of the code so far to be incredibly helpful because it is a much more detailed description of the step-by-step process of the code as it is running in dev tools. I tried my best to explain my understanding but I was uncertain of the correct words and over-generalizing the code from the break point of the renderTbl.The content was fairly easy to digest in the walkthru and helps to ease a bit of the pressure of the technical interview, which I'm sure I'll find a bit difficult.
